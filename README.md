## Description

Duration: 2 Day Sprint

This project taught me how to string pages together, while keeping state safe in the Redux store. I used React components alongside Redux to keep data together on the client side until it was ready to be sent all together to the server. From there I also have access to the database storing all feedback entries. The ability to delete or flag feedback is available from the admin component.

## Instructions

Please use npm install for dependencies, refer to pool.js for PORT info and check data.sql for database instructions.

Thank you!
